This is my solution to the Gilded Rose Kata. In this exercise one can practice how to refactor legacy code, a skill that will sure come in handy for the foreseeable future.
My solution sports exactly one test, and the commit history tells an interesting story from "blindly" refactoring to a seemingly clean solution and then extracting an actual object oriented solution from there, step by step.
